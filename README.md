Gait Recognition
================
As a behavioral biometric, gait recognition has gained an increased interest in recent years because it can operates without subject cooperation and from a distance. Here we present a novel gait feature extracting approach based on gait optical flow image (GOFI)decomposition. The variation of algebraic sum of all vertical optical flow components is used to detect gait cycles.  We calculate sums of horizontal and vertical optical flow components that greater than 0, respectively, for each row and column of GOFI to obtain four feature vectors of the subject. Two kinds of classifying method-PCA+LDA and DTW-are adopted. Experiments implemented on  the CASIA Database B and C demonstrate the approach achieves a 98\% recognition rate under normal walking condition, while a promising performance under the influence of other covariate factors.

This project is mainly programmed by Luo Zhengping, also named as Jimmy Lo, especially with the help of Li lin, also my teammate Wang Kaijie and Chen lin. Both of us we got a lot of beautiful points and help from our honorable tutor Prof.Yang, and personally I want to thank my two best friends Liu Yanjun and Deng Qi for their kindness and precious friendship.
